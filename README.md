# CandleStickPatterns
ML pattern matching Python Library

# Outline
This is a basic pattern matching library for Python 3.4+ that will read candlestick data (ohlc) and match common patterns. A test group of data is included, but for ease, sign up on Quandl.com for an account and use their get() to retrieve a pandas DataFrame.
